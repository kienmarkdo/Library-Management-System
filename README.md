### Concepts used
Some of the concepts I used for this project includes:
- OOP and Classes (inheritance, data encapsulation, abstraction, etc.)
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Memory management
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- ArrayList
- Private documentation (JavaDocs)
- Software developement

### Flexibility and Expandability
A Library Management System is also highly flexible for modifications. I can add on new features as I continue to learn new concepts such as:
- A GUI for a more user-friendly experience
- Web developement (publishing my program online so that it can be used by anyone)
- Database (SQL, mySQL)
- Mobile app developement (Android - creating an app so that the program is usable on Android and/or Apple phones)

<!--
### Why a Library Management System as a personal project?
This is a project that I have been meaning to do for a while. Out of the thousands of personal projects that I could have done, I decided to do this project based on my high school teacher's recommendation. Some concepts that I have focused on for this project include:
- OOP and Classes (inheritance, data encapsulation, abstraction, etc.)
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Memory management
- Authentication system
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- ArrayList
- Private documentation (JavaDocs)
- Software developement-->

<!--This project is perfect for me since I am learning OOP and Data Structures in my spare time in addition to the course *ITI 1520 - Intro to Computing II/Intro Ã  l'informatique II* in which I am enrolled.-->
